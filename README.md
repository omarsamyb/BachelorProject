The aim of this project is to implement a system that could reduce traffic accidents caused by the driver's fatigue and drowsiness factor. 
The system will use a headset with electrodes to record the driver's brain signals, these signals will then be used to detect if
the driver is lacking concentration on the road due to fatigue and urge to sleep. If the
driver is detected to be sleepy, the system will then warn the driver and take control over
the vehicle to bring it to a safe stop.
